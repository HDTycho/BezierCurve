# BezierCurve
A simple Bezier Curve generator that is based on De Casteljau's algorithm

It can be used to draw complex Bezier curves with an arbitrary number of control points, unlike quadratic or cubic bezier that has a very limited number of control points

Check out a [Live Demo](https://harish.tech/projects/Bezier-Curve/) of the implementation

The most minimal form of implementation is hosted [here](https://harish.tech/projects/Bezier-Curve/basic)

Feel free to use it if you find it interesting.
